;; Emacs counterpart of nvim/init.lua. `sidekick-setup' registers this Emacs
;; session with the sidekick server, spawns a `claude' terminal wired to the
;; session's MCP endpoint, and `sidekick-notify' pings Claude about the
;; current buffer. The server drives this session back through emacsclient,
;; calling `sidekick--rpc' with a base64-encoded JSON request.
